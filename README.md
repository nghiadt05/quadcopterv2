This is the second version of my quadcopter project, which is further developed from the  [first version](https://bitbucket.org/DoanTrungNghia/quadcopterv1). There are new improvements that are much better than those of the first version as described bellow:

- Use a more powerful micro controller (ARM Cortex M4)
- Use a better quadcopter frame with strong motors and high quality propellers  
- Well calibrated IMU
 
**The demo video is posted here:**

The IMU calibration process in terms of hard and soft iron noises for magnetic sensor is the implementation of [this paper](http://www.nxp.com/files/sensors/doc/app_note/AN4246.pdf). The IMU calibration process is integrated with the new user interface which is posted in the follow link: [IMU calibration demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDrIAQ7ofhY)
